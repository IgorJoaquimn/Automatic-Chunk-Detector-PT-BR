# Automatic Chunk Detector PT-BR
The objective of this project is to develop a chunk detector for use in a RAG app. The challenge arises when developing a RAG system that receives PT-BR YouTube subtitles as input, as there is no direct way to determine the boundaries of the chunks. The proposed solution is to implement a chunk detector using deep learning. The proposed approach involves the development of a system that is capable of identifying whether two sentences originate from the same paragraph. This system will subsequently be employed to segment the sentences into meaningful units, or "chunks".
